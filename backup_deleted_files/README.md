# Backup of Deleted Files

These files were removed from the project on cleanup because they were:
- Empty placeholder files
- Not imported anywhere in the codebase
- Causing or could cause duplicate definition errors

## Files Backed Up Here:

1. **VisualEffects.swift** 
   - Original location: `RuneWords/Views/VisualEffects.swift`
   - Reason for removal: Empty placeholder, all content moved to proper locations
   - Not imported by any file

2. **ParticleViews.swift**
   - Original location: `RuneWords/Views/ParticleViews.swift`  
   - Reason for removal: Empty placeholder, all particle effects are in `Components/ParticleEffects.swift`
   - Not imported by any file

## Important Note

These files are NOT needed for the project to build or run. They were safely removed because:
- No other files import them
- They contain no actual implementations
- All their original content has been properly relocated

If for some reason you need to restore them:
1. Move them back to `RuneWords/Views/`
2. But be aware this may cause duplicate definition errors

## Safe to Delete This Backup

Once you've confirmed the app builds and runs correctly without these files, you can safely delete this entire `backup_deleted_files` directory.

Date of cleanup: August 2025
